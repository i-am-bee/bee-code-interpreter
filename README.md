A gRPC service intended as a backend for an LLM that can run arbitrary pieces of Python code.

Built from the ground up to be safe and reproducible.

---

## ü™ë Local set-up

> [!NOTE]
> We have a [docker compose file](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) that is recommended if you only want to run bee-code-interpreter locally. Read on only if you wish to modify the code.

Pre-requisites:
- `git`
- `python` 3.12+
- `poetry`
- `poethepoet`
- `docker` and `kubectl` (we recommend using [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/))
- `grpcurl` (optional -- for testing)

### Clone this repo

This project contains submodules. Be sure to clone it with `git clone --recurse-submodules`, or initialize the submodules later with `git submodule update --init`.

### Install dependencies

```shell
poetry install
```

### üöÄ Run

First, prepare your Kubernetes cluster / namespace that will be used for running executors. If using a shared cluster, ensure that your user has all permissions for `pods` and `pods/exec` in this namespace. For local development, we recommend using the local cluster feature of [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/).

Ensure that the cluster can access the executor image. For Rancher Desktop, it is enough to build it, which will make it available in the cluster:

```bash
docker build -t localhost/bee-code-interpreter-executor:local executor
```

Finally, start the bee-code-interpreter service by running:

```bash
poe run
```

üéâ Bee Code Interpreter should now be running! You can test it using `grpcurl` from another terminal:

```bash
grpcurl -d '{"source_code":"print(\"hello world\")"}' -plaintext -max-time 60 127.0.0.1:50051 code_interpreter.v1.CodeInterpreterService/Execute
```


### üß™ Test

> [!WARNING]
> This project is using end-to-end tests that require a running instance to be executed against. Before running tests, ensure that you have the service (`poe run`) running in another terminal. 

```bash
poe test
```

---

## üì£ Publishing

```shell
poe publish $NEW_VERSION
```

## üß≥ Production set-up

All configuration options are defined and described in `src/code_interpreter/config.py`. You can override them using environment variables with `APP_` prefix, eg. `APP_EXECUTOR_IMAGE` to override `executor_image`.

For a production setup, ensure that you have the following:
- A Kubernetes cluster with a secure container runtime (gVisor, Kata Containers, Firecracker, etc.)
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Docker containers are not fully sandboxed by default. To protect from malicious attackers, do not skip this step.
- A service account, bound to the pod where `bee-code-interpreter` is running, with permissions to manage pods in the namespace it is configured to use.
  > ‚ÑπÔ∏è Bee Code Interpreter automatically uses a pod service account where available.
- The cluster must have the executor image available (either from a registry, or built from `./executor` in this repo).
- You may check the usability of the cluster using `python -m code_interpreter.kubernetes_check`.
- You may check the health of the local service using `python -m code_interpreter.health_check`.
